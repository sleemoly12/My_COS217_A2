What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was SO painful to complete, but I think I have a much better 
understanding of pointers and arrays now.

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

/* No. There are two functions that deal with sizes of arrays:
sizeOf, and Str_getLength. If we were to run Str_copy or Str_concat
and try to use assert and sizeOf to verify the sufficient length
of the destination memory area, the src and dst pointer will
carry merely 8 bytes of information, just enough memory to 'point'
to its content (but doesn't store the content itself.) Both the
src and dst pointer, no matter how long its content is, will 
always just be 8 bytes — which means assert will not be able to
verify any information about the size of the memory area itself,
sicne no matter the size of the content, the pointer itself will
only be 8 bytes.  

Alternatively, if we were to try and use Str_getLength instead of
sizeOf, the Str_getLength function will merely return the SIZE of
the array itself, without considering the fact that FEWER contents
of the array could be initialized. For example, there could be a
destination array of the size 10,000, but dst[0] could = '\0' —
meaning that dst[1]...dst[2]... and so on are garbage memory that
does not impact the size of the dst memory itself. In effect, it
is is a function that can indicate that there is enough space when
there is not, and not enough space when there is.

Hence, if both sizeOf and Str_getLength are not sufficient in getting
accurate lengths of the destination memory area, we can then conclude
that we CANNOT use asser tto verify destination memory length.
